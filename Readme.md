Phase Coherence Classification

The wavelet-based phase coherence classification decomposes signals such as the local field potential in electrophysiological recordings into subsignals depending on the pairwise phase-coherence relations. It then computes the power spectral densities of these subsignals thus allowing a detailed spectral analysis. For a detailed description see von Papen et al., Phase-coherence classification: a new wavelet-based method to separate local field potentials into local (in)coherent and volume-conducted components, Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 2017.
